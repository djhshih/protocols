- Trypsin/EDTA (e.g., Invitrogen)
- TE buffer, pH 8.0

\newpage

## Preparation
**DMEM Complete** 

Add 10% v/v FBS and 4 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine (or stable alternative, such as glutaGRO)^[FBS can be purchased already heat inactivated or it can be inactivated in the lab by heating to 56°C for 30 min] into DMEM

**PEI 1 mg/mL**

1. Dissolve 100 mg of powder in 100 mL of deionized water
2. While stirring, slowly add hydrochloric acid until the solution clears
3. Check the pH of the solution
4. Use hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH to 7.0.^[Typically, the solution will be basic and will need adjustment with hydrochloric acid first]
5. Allow the solution to mix for 10 min and then recheck the pH to ensure that it has not drifted
6. Filter the solution through a 0.22 μm membrane
7. Aliquot 500–1000 μL into sterile tubes
8. Store the tubes at -20 °C or -80 °C

- After thawing, the solution can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 months. After 2 months, discard the tube and thaw a new working stock
- The optimal mass DNA:mass PEI ratio will need to be empirically determined for each new batch of 1 mg/mL PEI and for each cell line


## NOTE
All solutions and equipment coming into contact with living cells must be sterile, and proper aseptic technique should be used accordingly.

All culture incubations should be performed in a humidified, 37°C, 5% CO~2~ incubator unless otherwise specified.

Do not add pen-strep to the media.

 Endotoxins can inhibit transfection; therefore, plasmid DNA purification should include an endotoxin removal step. For high quality plasmid DNA, the plasmids should also be propagated in an endonuclease negative E. coli strain such as NEB stable.

## CAUTION - biosafety
- P2 practices require that open tubes always be handled in the laminar flow hood. 
- Tubes can be taken out of the laminar flow only when they are closed, and that they be sprayed with 75% ethanol. 
- All solid waste and plasticware must be discarded in a trash bin in the laminar flow hoods and all liquids must be aspirated into a liquid waste bottle containing fresh concentrated bleach. 
- Refill the liquid waste bottle with fresh bleach when the color of the liquid is no longer yellow. 
- When full, bags are closed inside the laminar flow hood, then autoclaved. When full, and at least 10 min after neutralization with fresh bleach, the liquid waste bottle can be emptied into a regular sink. 
- In case of a major spill of vector-containing liquid, absorb liquid with paper towels and neutralize with fresh concentrated bleach prior to disposal.

# Procedure

## Prepare 293T cells for transfection

1. Maintain 293T cells in DMEM Complete, in T75 flask Split at a ratio of 1/10 using trypsin/EDTA, twice a week.^[ Do not use 293T cells that are in culture for more than 15 passages] 

2. Seed 2.5 $\times$ 10^6^ cells/10-cm dish the day before the transfection. Cells should be ~80% confluent on the day of transfection
    
## PEI Transfection

3. For each 10-cm plate, prepare 500 µL pDNA-OptiMEM mixture
  
  - 10 µg pDNA in OptiMEM that contains 
  
```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)

vector <- data.frame(
  vector_type = c("envelope", "packing", "rev", "transfer vector"),
  vectors = c("pMD2G, 1 eq", "pMDLg/pRRE, 1 eq", "pRSV-Rev, 1 eq", "pXXX, 2 eq")
)

kable(vector, caption = "eq = molar equivalents")
```

4. Prepare 500 µL PEI-OptiMEM mixture (30 μL 1 mg/mL PEI in 470 μL OptiMEM) such that the ratio of μg DNA:μg PEI is 1:3^[optimized ratio needs to be empirically determined] 

5. Add the diluted PEI dropwise while gently flicking the diluted DNA tube. Incubate the mixture 12–15 min at RT.

6. During the incubation, prepare 10 mL of DMEM Complete with 25 uM of chloroquine (final working conc.). 

7. After the incubation, add the DNA:PEI mix to the DMEM-chloroquine and mix well.

8. Remove media out of the previously seeded 10 cm plate.

9. Slowly pipette the transfection mix onto the 10 cm plate, being careful not to disturb the cells.

10. Incubate the cells for 18 h, or until the following morning.

11. Carefully aspirate the media. Replace the media with 10 mL of DMEM Complete or OptiMEM.

## Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection^[[2023-Joung-Zhang](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.11.026)]
1. Seed cells at ∼40% confluency 1 day prior to transfection. Cells are transfected the next day at ∼90-99% confluency. 

2. For each T25 flask

- 2.6 µg of psPAX2,
- 1.7 µg of pMD2.5G,
- 17.5 µL of Lipofectamine 3000
- 15 µL of P3000 Enhancer
- 1.25 mL OptiMEM

3. Change medium 5 h after transfection


## Harvest 

12. Virus can be harvested at 48 and 72 h post transfection in individual harvests or a combined harvest where all the individual harvests are pooled.^[If pooling harvests, transfer the harvested media to a polypropylene storage tube and store at 4 °C between harvest.]

13. Centrifuge the viral supernatant at 2100 rcf for 5 minutes to pellet any packaging cells that were collected during harvesting.

14. Filter supernatant through a 0.45 μm PES/PVDF filter.

15. For concentrating vector stocks:

*by PEG*
- Precipitate at 4°C overnight using PEG solution (BioCat, K904-50-BV). The lentiviral particles are then resuspended with PBS in 1/100 of the supernatant volume (100× concentrated). 

*by Ultracentrifuge*

- For each pooled supernatant, pipet 4 ml of 20% sucrose into the bottom of a 30-ml Beckman Konical tube.

- Very slowly pour the supernatant from step 14 onto the surface of the sucrose cushion until the tube is full (allow a 2-mm dry zone to the top of the tube).

- Ultracentrifuge 120 min at 50,000 × g, 16°C. 

- Gently discard the supernatant by inversion. 

- Let the tube dry inverted for 5 min.

- Resuspend the pellet (not always visible) with DMEM by pipetting up and down 50 times.

  - serum-free medium, such as CellGro, if subsequent experiments require the absence of serum, 

  - or PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ if subsequent experiments require the absence of protein

*by Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters* 

- Transfer viral supernatnat to Amicon Filter and spin filter in tabletop centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10-20 min at 4°C. 

- Concentrated virus can be aliquoted and stored at -80°C. Thaw an aliquot on ice before use; do not refreeze.

16. The viral supernatant can be stored at 4°C for several hours but should be aliquoted (50 µL in 1.5 mL screw-cap tubes) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C as soon as possible to avoid loss of titer.


## Titration
The titers ranged between 1 × 10^6^ and 6 × 10^7^ IFU ml^−1^
