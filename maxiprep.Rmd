This protocol extracts plasmid DNA from a large bacteria culture ($\ge 50$ mL) 
by first using the alkaline lysis method [@birnboim79] to remove lipids, 
polysaccharides, proteins, and genomic DNA, followed by RNA precipitation and 
RNase treatment to remove RNA, and phenol-chloroform to remove residuel proteins
such as nucleases. Except for initial bacteria pelleting, all subsequent 
centrifugations are carried out in 1.5 mL tubes in order to minimize
centrifugation times and machine requirement.
DNA purified by this protocol is suitable for most applications, including 
mammalian transfection.

# Materials

## Reagents
- Resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA)
- lysozyme (50 mg/mL in water; store at -20 $^\circ$C)^[
Lysozyme helps produce clearer and less viscous lysate, facilitating transfer.
Lysozme is required for gram-positive bacteria to digest peptidoglycan.]
- Alkaline lysis buffer (0.2 M NaOH, 1% SDS)
- Neutralization buffer (3 M potassium acetate, 2 M acetic acid)
- isopropanol
- 5 M lithium chloride
- 20 mg/mL RNase A
- Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 v/v)^[**Caution**: Phenol is clear
and colourless. Do not use oxidized phenol, which appears pink or red-brown.
**Warning**: Both phenol and chloroform are toxic and violatile: 
handle these in a fume hood.]
- Chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v)
- 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2
- ethanol and 70% ethanol
- Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA)

## Equipment
- 50 mL tubes; 1.5 mL tubes (12--13 per sample of 50 mL culture)
- Microcentrifuge
- Centrifuge (max speed of 1400 g or 3000--4000 rpm suffices)
- Fume hood

# Procedure

## Akaline lysis (1.5--2.5 h)

1. Pellet 50 mL of bacterial culture at 1400 g for 10 min.^[Speed is equivalent
to 3000--4000 rpm using centrifuge with 10--15 cm rotor.]

2. Resuspend pellet completely in 1 mL resuspension buffer. Ensure
no clumps remain.

3. *Optional*: Add 2.5 mg lysozyme (50 $\mu$L). Mix well.
Incubate on ice for 15--30 min.^[Prepare fresh alkaline lysis buffer meanwhile.]

4. Add 2.0 mL alkaline lysis buffer.^[SDS precipitates when buffer
is cold. Warm buffer to re-dissolve SDS.]
Mix *gently* by inverting 6 times and 
incubate at *room temperature* for 5 min.^[**Caution**: Do not vortex.
Avoid extended incbuation. Do not incubate on ice.]

5. Add 1.5 mL neutralization buffer. Mix *gently* by inverting 6 times.
Avoiding the floating debris, transfer and split the solution into $3\times$ 
1.5 mL tubes (~1 mL each).^[**Caution**: Debris may block the pipette tip.
Aspirate slowly to avoid contaminating the pipette shaft.]

6. Remove debris by centifugation at 14 000 g for 1 min.
Transfer the supernatant to new tubes,^[Place p200 pipette tip against wall.
Avoid collecting the white precipitate.]
placing $\le 800$ $\mu$L into each of 3 new tubes.

7. Precipitate the nucleic acids with 600 $\mu$L isopropanol. Mix well.
Pellet at 16 000 g for 1 min.^[Expect a 3--4 mm wide pellet.]
Discard supernatant immediately.

8. Wash the pellet with 200 $\mu$L of 70% ethanol.
Mix by inverting. Pellet at 16 000 g for 30 s.

9. Discard supernatant. Aspirate residual liquid. Dry pellet for 4 min.

10. Dissolve and combine pellets (from the same sample) in a total of 
500 $\mu$L of Tris-EDTA buffer.^[Use a p200 pipette. Multiple 50 mL cultures
with the same plasmid may be combined here. Ensuing pellet size
estimates are based on one culture of a high copy-number plasmid.]

## Removal of RNA contaminant (1.0--1.5 h)

11. Preciptate large RNA by adding 500 $\mu$L of 5 M LiCl. Mix well.
Incubate on ice for 5 min.

12. Pellet RNA contaminant at 16 000 g for 1 min.^[**Caution**:
DNA is in the supernatant. Do not discard. Expect a 4--5 mm wide, soft RNA 
pellet.]
Transfer supernatant into 2 new tubes (~0.6 mL each).

13. Precipitate DNA with 600 $\mu$L of isopropanol. Mix well.
Pellet at 16 000 g for 1 min.^[Expect a 2--3 mm wide DNA pellet.]
Discard supernatant immediately.

14. Wash the pellet with 100 $\mu$L of 70% ethanol. Mix by inverting.
Pellet at 16 000 g for 30 s.

15. Discard supernatant. Aspirate liquid. Dry pellet for 3 min.

16. Dissolve and combine the pellets (from the same sample) in a total of 
400 $\mu$L Tris-EDTA buffer.^[Use a p200 pipette.]
Add 5 $\mu$L of 20 mg/mL RNase A to digest remaining RNA.
Incubate at room temperature for 20 min.

## Removal of protein contaminant (10--20 min)

17. Add 700 $\mu$L phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol solution.^[
Phenol solution is topped with an aqueous phase of Tris-EDTA buffer. Use
the bottom, organic phase. Before dispensing phenol, pre-wet the pipette tip by
pipetting up fully and down once in order to avoid dripping.]
Vortex vigorously. Centrifuge at 16 000 g for 2 min.
Transfer the upper, aqueous phase to a new tube.^[**Caution**:
Do not collect the precipitates in the interphase.]

18. Repeat phenol-chloroform purification until interphase no longer appears
(1--2 additional rounds).

19. Add 700 $\mu$L chloroform:isoamyl alcohol.^[Pre-wet the pipette tip.]
Repeat as above in order to remove residual phenol.

20. Repeat the chloroform wash to ensure no phenol remains.

## DNA precipitation (40--50 min)

21. Precipitate DNA by adding 40 $\mu$L of 3 M sodium acetate and 1.0 mL 
of ethanol.^[Since DNase should have been removed and the sample should contain
$>10$ $\mu$g of DNA, cold would not improve yield [@zeugin85; @crouse87].]
Mix well. Pellet at 16 000 g for 30 min.^[Expect a 2--3 mm wide DNA pellet.]

22. Discard supernatant. Wash the pellet by adding 100 $\mu$L of 70% ethanol. 
Mix by inverting. Pellet at 16 000 g for 1 min.

23. Discard supernatant. Aspirate liquid. Dry pellet for 6 min.

24. Dissolve DNA in 100 $\mu$L Tris-EDTA buffer.^[Expect a yield of 
200--300 $\mu$g per 50 mL culture with a high copy-number plasmid.]

# Troubleshooting

- **No nucleic acid pellet**. All nucleic acid pellets should be visible.
Be sure to keep the supernatant after precipitation by lithium chloride, 
because the DNA is in the supernatant. The pellet produced in this step is the 
undesirable RNA contaminant.

- **Low molecular weight smear**. Extract is likely contaminated with RNA.
Do not skip RNA precipitation with lithium chloride.
Use fresh RNase A and/or extend incubation time.

- **High molecular weight smear**. Extract is likely contaminated with genomic 
DNA. Avoid vigorous mixing and reduce incubation time during alkaline lysis.

- **Degraded plasmid**. Keep the sample on ice as much as possible before 
phenol-chloroform purification, which removes nucleases.
Do additional phenol:chloroform:isoamyl purification until the interphase
disappears.

- **Suboptimal downstream application**. Phenol or ethanol residual may
interfere with downstream application.
Do additional chloroform wash to remove trace phenol.
Aspirate all residual liquid after ethanol wash and extend final pellet drying 
time.


# Timing

Total of 4-6 h for 2--4 samples.
