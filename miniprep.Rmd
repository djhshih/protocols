This protocol extracts plasmid DNA from a miniculture of bacteria using
the alkaline lysis method [@birnboim79]. The steps are simplified to reduce
time required to prepare plasmids suitable for restriction digest diagnosis.
Use maxiprep for cleaner extract.

# Materials

## Reagents
- Resuspension buffer with RNase A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 
100 ng/mL RNase A; store at 4 $^\circ$C)
- Alkaline lysis buffer (0.2 M NaOH, 1% SDS)
- Neutralization buffer (3 M potassium acetate, 2 M acetic acid)
- Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 v/v)
- 70% ethanol
- isopropanol

## Equipment
- 1.5 mL or 2.0 mL tubes
- Microcentrifuge

## Preparation

- **Resuspension buffer with RNase A**. For 100 mL,
    - 5 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0
    - 200 $\mu$L of 0.5 M EDTA
    - 500 $\mu$L of 20 mg/mL RNase A
    - 94.3 mL water

- **Alkaline lysis buffer**. For each mL of fresh solution,
    - 100 $\mu$L of 10% SDS
    - 50 $\mu$L of 4 M NaOH
    - 850 $\mu$L water

- **Neutralization buffer**. For 100 mL,
    - 60 mL of 5 M potassium acetate
    - 11.5 mL glacial acetic acid (17 M)
    - 28.5 mL water

# Procedure

## Akaline lysis

1. Pellet 1.5 mL of bacterial culture at 14 000 g for 30 s.^[Pellet another
1.5 mL of culture if growth is low.]

2. Resuspend pellet completely in 100 $\mu$L resuspension buffer. Ensure
no clumps remain.

3. Add 100 $\mu$L alkaline lysis buffer. Mix *gently* by inverting 5 
times.^[Vigorous vortexing may shear genomic DNA and prevent its subsequent
precipitation and removal.]

2. Add 120 $\mu$L neutralization buffer. Mix *gently* by inverting 5 times.
Incubate at room temperature for 3 min.

3. Remove debris^[containing proteins, lipids, and other contaminants] by 
centifugation at 14 000 g for 1 min.
Place a p100 pipette tip at bottom of tube^[Short centrifugation should collect 
the debris on the *side* wall. Avoid collecting the white precipitate.]
and aspirate supernatant to transfer to a new tube.

## Optional: Removal of protein contaminant

5. Add 200 $\mu$L of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol solution. Vortex.

6. Centrifuge at 16 000 g for 2 min. Transfer the upper, aqueous phase to a new
tube.^[For cleaner extract, repeat phenol-chloroform clean-up until interphase 
no longer appears, followed by 2 rounds of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v) 
clean-up.]

## DNA precipitation

7. Add 300 $\mu$L of isopropanol to preciptate the DNA. Mix well.

8. Pellet DNA at 16 000 g for 2 min.^[Expect a pellet 0.5--1.5 mm in width.
Larger pellet suggests RNA or genomic DNA contamination.]
Discard supernatant immediately.

9. Add 500 $\mu$L of 70% ethanol. Mix by inverting.
Pellet at 16 000 g for 1 min.

10. Discard supernatant. Aspirate residual liquid. Dry pellet for 6 min with
cap open.

11. Dissolve DNA in 20 $\mu$L Tris-EDTA^[Expect a yield of 20--40 $\mu$g.
Keeping the DNA at high concentration minimizes concentration of EDTA for 
downstream applications. Use of water instead of Tris-EDTA is discouraged 
unless phenol-chloroform purification has been done.]

12. Use 4 $\mu$L for gel electrophoresis or restriction digest.^[Contaminants
including RNA, genomic DNA, and free nucleotides will inflate UV absorbance 
measurements by spectrometers.]
Use immediately or store at -20 $\circ$C.

# Troubleshooting

- **No DNA pellet**. Ensure that 100% isopropanol (instead of diluted
isopropanol) is used for precipitation. If 100% ethanol is used for
precipitation, spin at 16 000 g for 30 min.

- **Low molecular weight smear** (< 1 kb). Extract is contaminated with RNA.
Possible remedies include:
    - Add fresh RNase A to resuspension buffer.
    - Incubate neutralized solution longer at room temperature.

- **Bright band < 100 bp**. Extract is contaminated with degraded RNA.
Treatment with RNase A will remove the RNA, but quantification by spectrometry
will still be optimistically biased due to absorbance by free nucleotides.

- **High molecular weight smear** (> 10 kb). Extract is likely contaminated 
with genomic DNA. Avoid vigorous mixing during alkaline lysis.
    
- **Unrealistically high DNA yield**. Extract is likely contaminated with RNA,
and/or possibly with genomic DNA. Quantification by spectrometry (e.g. NanoDrop)
is unreliable with this miniprep extract. Presence of genomic DNA can also
interfer with quantification using a DNA dye.

- **No electrophoresis bands after restriction digest**. If the extract is
contaminated with DNase (e.g. endA), incubation at 37 $^\circ$C in restriction 
digest buffer will permit DNase to degrade DNA. Do the phenol-chloroform
clean-up; repeat phenol-chloroform until the interphase disappears.


# Timing

Total of 30--45 min for 2--6 samples.
