This reporter assay is a type of host reactivation assay that assesses the 
mismatch repair pathway[@zhou09]. A plasmid with a single base-pair mismatch 
(known as a **heteroduplex plasmid**) will be prepared and transfected into 
cells, followed by flow cytometry to quantify the proportion of mismatch repair 
competent cells.

## Preparation

- **Sodium acetate (3 M)**. Dissolve 24.6 g of anhydrous sodium acetate in 
70 mL of water. (Or use 40.8 g of NaCH~3~COO^--^ $\cdot$ 3H~2~O.)
Adjust the pH to 5.2 with glacial acetic acid (~10 mL).
Adjust final volume to 100 mL. Autoclave to sterilize.

- **Ammonium acetate (8 M)**. Dissolve 77 g of ammonium acetate in 53 mL of 
water at room temperature. Adjust final volume to 125 mL.
Sterilize by passing solution through a 0.22 $\mu$m filter. Do *not* autoclave.
Store at 4 $^\circ$C.

- **Sodium hydroxide (2 M)**. Dissolve 4.0 g of NaOH in 40 mL of water within
a plastic container. Adjust final solution to 50 mL.

- **KCl (2 M)**. Dissolve 14.9 g of KCl in 70 mL of water. Adjust final volume
to 100 mL. Autoclave to sterilize.

- **Sodium phosphate buffer (1 M, pH 7.0)**.
Mix 3.9 mL of 1 M NaH~2~PO~4~ (monobasic) 
and 6.1 mL of 1 M Na~2~HPO~4~ (dibasic)^[Na~2~HPO~4~ tends to precipitate
out of solution; warm to re-dissolve before use.].
To prepare stock solutions,
dissolve 13.8 g of NaH~2~PO~4~ (monobasic) in 70 mL of water and 
adjust final volume to 100 mL; similarly,
dissolve 14.2 g of Na~2~HPO~4~ (dibasic) in final volume of 100 mL.

- **Acetic acid (4 M)**. Dilute 2.3 mL of glacial (anhydrous) acetic acid in 
7.7 mL of water.

# Procedure

## Create circular single-strand wildtype plasmid

1. Nick the wildtype plasmid with Nb.Bpu10I.
Mix together^[Calculate amount of water required and add it first.]
    - p111 plasmid, 20 $\mu$g
    - 10$\times$ Thermo buffer R, 40 $\mu$L of 
    - 5 U/$\mu$L Nb.Bpu10I, 4 $\mu$L (20 U)
    - Nuclease-free water, to 400 $\mu$L

    Incubate at 37 $^\circ$C for 1 h.

2. Add 0.5 volume (200 $\mu$L) of phenol and 0.5 volume of chloroform/isoamyl
alcohol, vortex for 10 s, and centrifuge at 10 000 rpm for 5 min.

3. Transfer the upper, aqueous phase to a fresh tube. Add 1 volume (400 $\mu$L)
    of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Vortex and centrifuge for 5 min.
    
    Repeat chloroform/isoamyl alchol wash 2$\times$ more.

4. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a fresh tube. Add 0.1 volume of 3 M
sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. Mix.

    Incubate at -20 $^\circ$C for 1 h.
    
5. Centrifuge at 16 000 g for 30 min and discard supernatant. Wash pellet with
200 $\mu$L of 70% ice-cold ethanol.

    Dry the DNA pellet.
    
6. Dissolve DNA in 50 $\mu$L of nuclease-free water.

7. Remove the nicked strand with exonuclease III.
Add and mix (250 $\mu$L total volume)
    - Nuclease-free water, 169 $\mu$L
    - 10$\times$ NEBuffer 1, 25 $\mu$L
    - 100 U/$\mu$L Exonuclease III, 6 $\mu$L (600 U)

    Incubate at 37 $^\circ$C for 1 h.
    
    Heat inactivate at 70 $^\circ$C for 20 min.
    
8. Extract the reaction mixture with phenol/chloroform as before.
Precipitate with *ammonium* acetate and ethanol: Add 0.25 volume of 8 M
ammonium acetate^[reduces co-precipitation of dNTPs] and 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 
ethanol. Mix and proceed as before.

9. Dissolve DNA in 10--30 $\mu$L of nuclease-free water.


## Prepare the linearized mutant plasmid

1. Cut the mutant plasmid with AseI.
Mix together^[Calculate amount of water required and add it first.]
    - p189 plasmid, 60 $\mu$g (3$\times$ initial amount of p111 plasmid)
    - 10$\times$ NEBuffer 3.1, 40 $\mu$L of 
    - 10 U/$\mu$L AseI, 2 $\mu$L (20 U)
    - Nuclease-free water, to 400 $\mu$L

    Incubate at 37 $^\circ$C for 16 h.^[After 16 h of digestion, extended 
    activity enzymes (+++) such as AseI require only 0.13 U to digest 
    1 $\mu$g of DNA.]
    
    Heat inactivate at 65 $^\circ$C for 20 min.

2. Purify linearized plasmid with phenol/cholorform and precipitate with
ethanol and sodium acetate as before.

3. Dissolve DNA in 10--30 $\mu$L of nuclease-free water.


## Create the heteroduplex plasmid

1. Combine the single-strand wildtype plasmid with the linearized mutant 
plasmid in 1:3 molar ratio. Adjust final volume to 100 $\mu$L with nuclease-free
water. Mix well.

2. Denature the DNA by adding 0.2 volume (20 $\mu$L) of 2 M sodium hydroxide.
Mix *gently*.

    Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.

3. Neutralize the solution by adding
    - 0.4 volume (40 $\mu$L) of nuclease-free water
    - 0.1 volume of 2 M KCl
    - 0.2 volume of 1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0
    - 0.1 volume of 4 M acetic acid

    Incubate at 65 $^\circ$C for 30 min.
    
    Slowly cool to 37 $^\circ$C over 2 h.
    
    Incubate at 30 $^\circ$C for 30 min.
    
4. Keep on ice for 5 min.

5. Isolate the DNA by ethanol and sodium acetate precipitation as 
before.^[Alternatively, use QIAquick PCR Purification Kit.]

6. Dissolve DNA in 50 $\mu$L of nuclease-free water.

7. Degrade leftover linearized plasmid and circular single-strand plasmid.
Add and mix (250 $\mu$L total volume)
    - Nuclease-free water, 160 $\mu$L
    - 25 mM ATP, 10 $\mu$L
    - 10$\times$ Plasmid-Safe Reaction Buffer, 25 $\mu$L
    - 10 U/$\mu$L Plasmid-Safe DNase, 5 $\mu$L (50 U)

    Incubate at 37 $^\circ$C for 16 h.
    
    Heat inactivate at 70 $^\circ$C for 30 min.

8. Assess plasmid purity by agarose gel electrophoresis. Compare
    - wildtype plasmid
    - circular single-strand wildtype plasmid
    - linearized mutant plasmid
    - heteroduplex plasmid

9. If heteroduplex plasmid purity is high, purify heteroduplex plasmid with 
phenol/cholorform and precipitate with ethanol and *ammonium* acetate.^[Gel 
purification may be required if heteroduplex plasmid is not pure.]


# Remarks

The overall objective is to anneal the wildtype coding strand with the mutant
template strand. The above protocol isolates the wildtype coding strand with
N**b**.Bpu10I and Exonuclease III. However, the mutant plasmid is simply
denatured (therefore, both mutant coding and template strands are present).
We may also prepare the mutant template strand with N**t**.Bpu10I and 
Exonuclease III.


# Troubleshooting




# Timing




# Anticipated results

GFP^+^ cells are mismatch-repair competent. As positive and negative controls,
HeLa is a MMR-proficient cell line, and HCT116 is MMR-deficient.
