This protocol purifies DNA from cell lysate using phenol and chloroform to
remove contaminating protein and lipds.

# Materials

## Reagents
- Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 v/v, pH 8.0)^[**Caution**: 
Use of acidic phenol will cause DNA to fractionate into the organic phase, 
complicating subsequent purification. Ensure that correct phenol is used.
Do not use oxidized phenol, which appears pink or red-brown.
**Warning**: Both phenol and chloroform are toxic and violatile: handle these
- Chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v)
- 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 *or* 8 M ammonium acetate
- ethanol *or* isopropanol
- 70% ethanol
- Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA)

## Equipment
- 1.5 mL or 2.0 mL tubes
- Microcentrifuge
- Fume hood

## Preparation

- **Sodium acetate (3 M)**. Dissolve 24.6 g of anhydrous sodium acetate in 
70 mL of water. (Or use 40.8 g of NaCH~3~COO^--^ $\cdot$ 3H~2~O.)
Adjust the pH to 5.2 with glacial acetic acid (~10 mL).
Adjust final volume to 100 mL. Autoclave to sterilize.

- **Ammonium acetate (8 M)**. Dissolve 77 g of ammonium acetate in 53 mL of 
water at room temperature. Adjust final volume to 125 mL.
Sterilize by passing solution through a 0.22 $\mu$m filter. Do *not* autoclave.
Store at -4 $^\circ$C.

- **Tris-EDTA buffer**. Add 1 mL of 1 M Tris-HCL pH 8.0 and 0.2 mL of 0.5 M
EDTA to 98.8 mL of nuclease-free water.

# Procedure

1. Dilute sample up to 400 $\mu$L with water, or split sample.^[If isopropanol 
will be used for precipitation, sample may have volume up to 700 $\mu$L.]

2. Add 1$\times$ volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol solution.^[
Phenol solution is topped with an aqueous phase of Tris-EDTA buffer. Use
the bottom, organic phase. Before dispensing phenol, pre-wet the pipette tip by
pipetting up fully and down once in order to avoid dripping.]
Vortex vigorously. Centrifuge at 16 000 g for 2 min to seprate the phases.
Transfer the upper, aqueous phase to a new tube.^[**Caution**:
Do not collect the precipitates in the interphase.]

3. Repeat phenol-chloroform purification until interphase no longer appears
(0--2 additional rounds).

4. Add 1$\times$ volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol.^[Pre-wet the pipette 
tip.] Repeat as above in order to remove residual phenol.

5. Repeat the chloroform wash to ensure no phenol remains.

6. Precipitate DNA by adding 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes 
of ethanol.^[If sample contains $>1$ $\mu$g of DNA, cold does not improve yield 
[@zeugin85; @crouse87]. Overnight incubation at 4 $^\circ$C results in a bigger
pellet due to more salt co-precipitation.]
Mix well. Centrifuge at 16 000 g for 30 min at 4 $^\circ$C.

7. Discard supernatant. Wash the pellet by adding 500 $\mu$L of 70% ethanol. 
Mix by inverting. Pellet at 16 000 g for 1 min.

8. Discard supernatant. Aspirate residual liquid. Dry pellet for 10 min with
cap open.

9. Dissolve DNA in Tris-EDTA buffer or nuclease-free water.

## Alternative methods for DNA precipitation

- **Alternative 1**. To prevent co-precipitation of free nucleotides, preciptate
    DNA by adding 0.25 volume of 8 M ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of
    ethanol.^[Residual ammonium ions will inhibit T4 polynucleotide kinase, so
    do not use ammonium if purified DNA is to be phosphorylated.]
    
- **Alternative 2**. For a quicker precipitation or smaller reaction volume,
use isopropanol in place of ethanol. After adding sodium or ammonium acetate, 
add 0.7--1.0 volume of isopropanol.
Mix well. Pellet DNA at 16 000 g for 1--5 min at room temperature.

# Troubleshooting

- **Low yield**. The starting amount of DNA in the sample is likely low.
Possible remedies include:
    - During ethanol precipitation, incubate overnight at 4 $^\circ$C.
    - After transferring as much of the aqueous phase as possible (without
    contaminants) to the new tube, add water to the original tube, repeat
    the centrifugation, and combine the new aqueous phase with the old one.
    - During precipitation, add 20 $\mu$g of glycogen before adding ethanol in
    order to promote DNA precipitation and pelleting.

- **Phenol contamination**. Do additional chloroform purifications to 
remove all trace phenol.

- **High salt contamination**. Do additional 70% ethanol washes.


# Timing

Total of 20--60 min for 2--6 samples.
